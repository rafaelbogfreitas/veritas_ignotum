      There are plenty of motivations to actively obscure and manipulate the truth, especially where personal accounts, legalities and matters of conduct are involved. Such divergences from truth can cause severe ramifications for both large companies and individuals when regarding liability, responsibility and duty. Simplified VI analyses the exchange of both verbal and non-verbal communication to identify deception. The deception or lie can be identified as “a deliberate attempt to mislead someone without prior notification” (Ekman 2009) &sup1;. However, observing, identifying and differentiating deception from truth can be a challenging task. This due to what a lie is described to be, does not necessarily expose how deceptive behaviour presents. Behavioural research of the correlations between emotions and cognition has set the fundamentals of understanding how behaviour can be related to lie-detection. One of the most comprehensive models of behavioural analysis also the one VI employs, is the SCAnR© Model &sup2;. According to the SCAnR© model, there is an intricate connection between emotions and cognition which manifests into a behaviour referred to a leakage (What VI identifies). This behaviour is exhibited through six communication channels:

      According to research (Archer & Lansley 2015) to differentiate truth from a lie the above-mentioned channels and exhibited behaviour is expected to be consistent with three main subject:
    </p>
    <ul class="science__list">
      <li class="science__list-item text">
        <strong><em class="science__list-head">the account</em> of the speaker of the narrative he is discussing; the speakers'.</strong>
      </li>
      <li class="science__list-item text">
        <strong><em class="science__list-head">baseline</em> behaviour of the individual.</strong>
      </li>
      <li class="science__list-item text">
        <strong><em class="science__list-head">the context</em> or the setting the situation is developing in (ex. Interview, self-edited video, politics, recruitment).</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">
      However, if there is a lie there is an imbalance between emotion and cognition, which leads to leaks that can come through the six communication channels. When someone is being deceptive they have to try and keep the balance between physicality, emotion and cognition, whilst keeping calm and to remember everything that has said. The higher the stakes involved the more the pressure endured leading to leaks through one or more of the six communication channels.  These leaks are called Points of Interest (PINs). On their own, they are simply interesting to observe and they do not necessarily mean that the person is lying. However, clusters of PINs during a 7-second timeframe of a stimulus can be highly indicative of deceptive behaviour, especially if other reasons such as discomfort or anxiety have been ruled out.

      Initially, behavioural leaks were first noticed only in the psychophysiological communication channel. The underlying research on behavioural analysis was based upon the fight or flight response. It didn’t take long for psychologists, behaviour scientists and neurologists to see how it can be applied to lie detection. This led to the creation of a widely controversial tool – the polygraph colloquially known as the “lie detector”. In essence, this is simply a detector of the psychophysiological reaction involved with deception (such as increased heart rate). It provides measurement of the above mentioned physiological response to a targeted question with the aim to distinct truth from deception. Unfortunately, the assessment of lies and truth is coming from a single communication channel only – psychophysiology. The use of the polygraph and the strict ethically questionable&sup3;instructions people need to follow (such as to sit still throughout the test and to answer only with a yes or no) significantly limit the possibilities to extract information from other channels of communication. Moreover, it also prevents us from differentiating between different emotions&#8308; which subjects can feel during a polygraph test since it is only measuring the physiological responses. The highly controversial nature of the polygraph has been confirmed by National Academy of Sciences&#8309; which released a report that has acknowledged that there is not enough empirical support on the accuracy of the polygraph since most of the research has been based on specific cases which cannot be generalized. Due to a massive amount of popularity and interest that the polygraph has received throughout its application, has in turn lead to the demise with the interest towards the research associated with it, making it too rigid and unable to respond or adapt to contemporary behavioural research in deception detection. However, those failures have managed to highlight what is missing from behavioural research in order to enrich the science behind it and provide empirically-based tools.

    <p class="text">
      The current research in the field of behavioural analysis has been more focused on a less invasive way of differentiating truth from lie. It is also highly focused on retaining information from a maximum amount of communication channels to provide greater reliability. The combination of the scientific evidence behind channel provides the SCAnR© method with a wide range of opportunities in the analysis.
