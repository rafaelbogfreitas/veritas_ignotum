      There are plenty of motivations to actively obscure and manipulate the truth, especially where personal accounts, legalities and matters of conduct are involved. Such divergences from truth can cause severe ramifications for both large companies and individuals when regarding liability, responsibility and duty. Simplified VI analyses the exchange of both verbal and non-verbal communication to identify deception. The deception or lie can be identified as “a deliberate attempt to mislead someone without prior notification” (Ekman 2009)1. However, observing, identifying and differentiating deception from truth can be a challenging task. This due to what a lie is described to be, does not necessarily expose how deceptive behaviour presents. Behavioural research of the correlations between emotions and cognition has set the fundamentals of understanding how behaviour can be related to lie-detection. One of the most comprehensive models of behavioural analysis also the one VI employs, is the SCAnR© Model2. According to the SCAnR© model, there is an intricate connection between emotions and cognition which manifests into a behaviour referred to a leakage (What VI identifies). This behaviour is exhibited through six communication channels:
