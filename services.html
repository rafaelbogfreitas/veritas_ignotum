        We naturally assume that we have a reliable intuition for spotting a lie, though it has been proven that the innate ability of untrained individuals to accurately identify a lie hidden among truth is no better than chance. Meta-analysis demonstrates this averaged at around 54% for correct Truth-Lie judgements, 61% for truth detection and at 47% for deceptions (Bond & DePaulo 2006)1. However, the accuracy with which a specialist consultant can differentiate deception from the truth in a controlled environment rises tomore than 70% (Hartwig & Bond, 2011)2 once they have received adequate training.  We utilise scientifically tested interviewing methods, pinpoint the hallmarks of deception through the procedural analysis of behavioural language, and enable our clientele to make better decisions, based on deliverable data.

        VI specialists can provide two types of analysis:
      </p>
      <p class="text text--dark">
        Real-Time – This is the most direct approach however secondary and tertiary analysis cannot always be conducted in tandem.  Ideally used when time and or resources are limited, boardroom and recruitment situations would be most akin to utilizing this method.
      </p>
      <p class="text text--dark">
        Retrospective – This can be somewhat more convenient though has limitations as the analysis can only be conducted with the media that has been provided, such as transcripts, audio files and videography. This can prove a more comprehensive approach.

      <p class="text text--dark">
        Contemporary behavioural analysis has long moved on from the confinements of the polygraph. While it all started with the research on the emotions and their biological function to prepare the organism for physiological reactions it wasn’t long before many realized that this is not an isolated event and it should not be treated as such. Emotional and behavioural responses are highly dependent on cognitive appraisals and idiosyncratic differences and they never remain isolated as a situation but are always happening in a context. Therefore to the SCAnR© model is a widely comprehensive approach that allows analysts to combine a large amount of scientific evidence to best analyze and pinpoint inconsistencies in a statement, while at the same time not ignoring different emotions, idiosyncratic baselines, contextual importance and ethical considerations.
